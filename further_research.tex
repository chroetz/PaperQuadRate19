The growth condition, especially for power Fréchet means, see section \ref{sssec:app:hadamard:pfm}, needs to be studied further to get a better understanding of what properties a distribution must have, so that all power means can be estimated with the same rate.

In \cite{bacak14} the author describes algorithms for calculating means and medians in Hadamard spaces, i.e., power Fréchet means as in section \ref{sssec:app:hadamard:pfm} with $a\in\{\frac12, 1\}$. As we have shown results also for $a \in (\frac12,1)$, it would be interesting to see, whether one can generalize the algorithms for $a = \frac12$ and $a=1$ to $a\in[\frac12, 1]$.

We plan to use the results of this paper in a regression setting similar to \cite{petersen16}. We will show convergence rates for an orthogonal series-type regression estimator for the conditional Fréchet mean $m(x) \in \argmin_{q\in\mc Q}\Ex*{\mf c(Y,q) | X=x}$.
